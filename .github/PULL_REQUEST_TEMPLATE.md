Hacktoberfest
We at DSC BVP Pune organised this event to spread awareness about the importance of Open Source Development.

Lace iT
Lace iT is a simple shoe shopping website that a user can get up and running. Just update your details and social media links in the Folio/lib/main.dart file. 

PS, you will have to update a few files before you are ready to upload , but that is beyond the scope of this workshop.

Website
Website is a base template for DSC BVP Pune's website. We added a few base details to it and asked the contributors to add they're images and details on the website.
